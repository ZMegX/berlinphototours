          Welcome to your next adventure in Berlin, part photography workshop, part city tour,
          and all about creativity! Whether you're picking up a camera for the first time or
          looking to sharpen your eye, our tours offer a relaxed, hands-on way to learn the
          basics of photography while exploring the diverse and dynamic city of Berlin.

          From iconic landmarks to hidden corners,
          each tour is designed to help you see the city, and your camera in a whole new light. 
          Bring your DSLR, phone, point-and-shoot, or anything in between. We believe great photos come 
          from great moments, not just fancy gear.
